## 🥳 Hi, I'm Yasmin - Junior Software Developer

I recently graduated from General Assembly and am fresh on the scene and ready for a change after a short-lived career as a freelance photographer (thanks covid).
I'm passionate about the intersections of technology, community and creativity. Since entering the industry I've participated in community events, given a few talks, and am currently co-organising the 🚂 RoRoSyd meetup (pls dm me if you want to give a talk we always need speakers).

When I'm not doing *computer nerd things* in my spare time I do *art nerd things* and am perpetually teaching myself how to sew, play guitar, and ceramics.

## 👩‍💻 I'm actively working on
- A generative text algorithm that spits out *on-theme* response emails for a literary art project I picked up as some freelance work
- Trying to make react and progressive enhancement friends

## 🤯 I'm currently exploring 
##### 🫠 To varying degrees 
- How to make progressive enhancement work with react
- Three.js
- Algorithms
- Machine Learning
- Learning a lisp language 
- Not being afraid of math (work in progress)

## 💃🕺 I'm looking to collaborate on
Anything cool, but I particularly want to jump in and work on back-end stuff.
